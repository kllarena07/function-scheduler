# Inspiration

I recently created a [project](https://github.com/kllarena07/safa-message-scheduler) that involved scheduling lambda functions and noticed a lack of abstractions that take care of this. So, I wanted to create my own SDK that will schedule a lambda function.

You will be able to code your lambda function locally and then read the code file in to be scheduled on AWS.

## Technologies Used

- AWS Lambda
- AWS EventBridge Scheduler
